This directory contains the tests for the library.
The tests are executed on the PC, not on the ARM.

To compile the tests, you need to have a 32bit GCC installed.

For Debian/Ubuntu based systems this can be done with:
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 lib32stdc++-4.8-dev

The tests can be either started from within Eclipse, or on
the commandline with lib-tests/Debug/lib-tests

For a developer introduction to the test framework Catch, please see
https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md

To get colored output in the Eclipse console, install the Eclipse
plugin "Local Terminal". Linux only. For details see
