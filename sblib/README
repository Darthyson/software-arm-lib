Selfbus EIB Library
===================

The library uses the following ARM components:

Bus access:

- Pin P1.8 for EIB IN
- Pin P1.9 for EIB OUT
- Pin P2.0 for programming mode led and button
- 16bit Timer #1


Test setup
----------

For the ARM you can use a LPCxpresso prototyping board. The LPC1115 is ideal,
but LPC1114 also works.

For bus access you can use a Selfbus LPC controller board. Any controller
board should be sufficient, even a module like the Gira smoke detector.

Remove the LPC922 from the controller board and make connections from the following
pins of the LPC922 socket to the ARM prototyping board:

LPC pin 2 to ARM pin P2.0
LPC pin 3 to ARM pin P1.9
LPC pin 5 to ARM pin GND
LPC pin 8 to ARM pin P1.8

Add a 100pF condensator between ARM pin 1.8 and GND


BCU type
--------

Application and library must have the same BCU type. The BCU type is set by
the compile time constant BCU_TYPE. It has to bei either 10 (for BCU 1) or 20
(for BCU 2). If in doubt, use BCU 1.

To configure it, navigate in Eclipse into the project properties,
C/C++ Build > Settings > Tool Settings (tab) > MCU C++ Compiler > Preprocessor

In the top box "Defined symbols (-D)" there shall be a line BCU_TYPE=10  (or =20)
its there for the library and the same line shall be in the application project
