/**
 * @brief Maps a 16-bit (0x0-0xffff) virtual address space onto pages of physical flash memory.
 *
 * @details
 * MemMapper provides a virtual memory abstraction over a region of on-chip flash memory.
 * The virtual address space is partitioned into 256 byte pages.
 * Entries are stored XOR-inverted (raw = value ^ 0xff) so that an erased flash
 * byte (0xff) is interpreted as "unallocated" (logical value 0).
 * Write operations are buffered in a RAM write buffer (@ref ramBuffer) and only
 * committed to flash on demand via @ref doFlash(). The allocation table is accessed
 * directly in flash for reads. Writes stage the full table page into @ref ramBuffer
 * before committing via IAP. If @ref autoAddPage is @c true,
 * a new physical flash page is allocated automatically when a write
 * targets an unmapped virtual page. Otherwise, pages must be pre-allocated
 * with @ref addRange() before writing.<br>
 * Physical flash layout of the managed memory region:
 * @code
 *   Offset 0 : allocation table (one flash page, @ref FLASH_PAGE_SIZE bytes)
 *   Offset FLASH_PAGE_SIZE: first usable data page
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The physical start address of the managed region is @code FLASH_BASE_ADDRESS + allocationTablePtr @endcode.
 * @note One flash page is @c FLASH_PAGE_SIZE (256) bytes on supported targets.
 *
 * @warning The first flash page of the managed region is reserved for the <em>allocation
 *          table</em> that maps virtual page indices to physical flash page numbers.
